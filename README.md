Note:
If you want, I can tailor this README even more specifically — for example, if the repo is focused only on DSA problems, or has folders like basic, advanced, etc., I can add examples and a table of contents too.

Would you like me to create a little fancier version with badges (like Go version, License, Stars)? 🌟
